# Steganography
This project is an implementation of Image Based Steganography. 
Steganography is the practice of encrypting or hiding data in a physical or virtual object in a way that the hidden data is not obvious to an unsuspecting person.
This project uses Python, and Object Oriented Programming to implement classes and data for this project.
OOP organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic.
